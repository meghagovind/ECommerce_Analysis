## 🛒 E-commerce Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project analyzes online retail data to uncover customer insights, sales performance, and profitability trends. Using Python (Jupyter Notebook), Excel, and Power BI, I built an end-to-end pipeline to clean raw data, perform customer segmentation, and visualize business metrics.

The interactive dashboard provides a 360° view of revenue, profit, average order value, and customer behavior, enabling data-driven decisions for marketing and retention strategies.

## 📂 Project Files

Ecommerce_Analysis.ipynb → Data cleaning, transformation, and RFM segmentation logic in Python.

Online_Retail.xlsx → Raw dataset (transactional data).

Online_Retail_Cleaned.csv → Processed dataset used for analysis and reporting.

## ⚙️ Key Steps & Methodology

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Removed duplicates, missing values, and invalid transactions.

Standardized product descriptions and customer IDs.

Exported a cleaned dataset for reproducibility.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified sales trends across years, quarters, and months.

Tracked gross profit, profit margin, and average order value.

Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) metrics calculated for each customer.

Segmented customers into groups (e.g., Champions, Loyal, At Risk).

Documented repeatable workflows for quarterly analysis.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

Revenue: $13.6M (+13.26%)

Gross Profit: $11.3M (+13.4%)

Avg Order Value: $137 (-2.37%)

Profit Margin: 68% (+13.19%)

## Key Visuals:

Revenue & Profit trend over time

Profit Margin gauge vs industry benchmark
